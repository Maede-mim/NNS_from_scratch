# Neural Networks from Scratch

Welcome to my **Neural Networks from Scratch** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to building neural networks using pure Python, without relying on any high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. 

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find step-by-step implementations of key neural network components, including:

- **Feedforward Neural Networks**: Understand the architecture and workings of basic neural networks, and see how they can learn from data.
- **Backpropagation Algorithm**: Dive deep into the training process and learn how to optimize network weights using gradient descent.
- **Activation Functions**: Explore various activation functions and their impact on learning efficiency and model performance.
- **Loss Functions**: Learn how to evaluate model performance and guide training through loss calculations.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement methods like dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Features

- Clean, well-documented code to facilitate learning and understanding.
- Interactive examples and visualizations to illustrate concepts clearly.
- Real-world datasets for hands-on experience with training and testing models.
